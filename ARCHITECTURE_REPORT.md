  // Real-time waveform rendering
  for (let i = 0; i < barCount; i++) {
    const barHeight = Math.random() * canvas.height * 0.8;
    ctx.fillStyle = `hsl(${200 + i * 3}, 70%, 50%)`;
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, barWidth - 2, barHeight);
  }
};
```

**Key Features:**

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Theme detection and persistence
const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(() => {
  const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
  if (savedTheme) return savedTheme === 'dark';
  return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Improved user experience in low-light conditions
- Reduced eye strain for extended learning sessions
- Consistent theme across all components
- Accessibility compliance

### 3. Authentication & Secure Purchases ✅

**Security Implementation:**
- JWT token management with automatic refresh
- Protected route system with authentication guards
- Secure password requirements with visual feedback
- XSS prevention through input sanitization

**Authentication Flow:**
```javascript
// Secure token management
useEffect(() => {
  const checkAuth = async () => {
    const decodedToken = jwtDecode(storedToken);
    if (decodedToken.exp > currentTime) {
      setToken(storedToken);
      const response = await axios.get('/api/user/profile');
      setUser(response.data.user);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

**Shopping Cart Features:**
- React Context for state management
- Local storage persistence
- Real-time price calculations
- Secure checkout flow ready for payment integration

### 4. Real-Time Validation ✅

**Validation System:**
- HTML5 Constraint Validation API integration
- Custom validation rules for complex requirements
- Real-time feedback with visual indicators
- Accessibility-compliant error messages

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Advanced password validation
validatePassword(password) {
  if (password.length < 8) return { isValid: false, message: 'Password must be at least 8 characters' };
  if (!/(?=.*[a-z])/.test(password)) return { isValid: false, message: 'Must contain lowercase letter' };
  if (!/(?=.*[A-Z])/.test(password)) return { isValid: false, message: 'Must contain uppercase letter' };
  if (!/(?=.*\d)/.test(password)) return { isValid: false, message: 'Must contain number' };
  return { isValid: true };
}
```

### 5. Dashboard & Analytics ✅

**Data Visualization:**
- Chart.js integration with React-Chartjs-2
- Multiple chart types: Line, Bar, Doughnut
- Responsive charts that adapt to screen size
- Real-time data updates

**Analytics Features:**
- Learning progress tracking
- Performance metrics visualization
- Skill level assessments
- Achievement system with badges

## Security Measures

### Frontend Security
1. **Input Validation**: Client-side validation with server-side verification
2. **XSS Prevention**: Sanitized user inputs and secure rendering
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with expiration handling
4. **Route Protection**: Authentication guards for sensitive pages

### Data Protection
- Secure token storage with automatic cleanup
- Password strength enforcement
- Form validation prevents malicious inputs
- Error handling without information leakage

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Route-based lazy loading with React.lazy()
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Bundle size optimization

### Asset Optimization
- Responsive images with proper sizing
- Lazy loading for media content
- Minification and compression in production

### State Management
- Efficient Context usage to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Local state for UI interactions
- Memoization for expensive calculations

## Scalability Considerations

### Component Architecture
- Reusable component library
- Separation of concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Modular file structure
- Custom hooks for shared logic

### State Management Strategy
```javascript
// Scalable context pattern
export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // Centralized auth state
  // Token management
  // API integration
  return <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>;
};
```

### API Integration
- Axios interceptors for consistent error handling
- Modular API structure for different features
- Request/response transformation
- Automatic token attachment
